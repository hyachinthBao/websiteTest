        <p class="thought"> You are walking your way home through Gotham City as you have finished your tiring 9-5 job as a banker. Then suddenly, a man appears from the sky!</p>
        <p class="man"> Man: "Hello, this is Man! The Jonkler has invaded the Aslume and we need your help!" </p>
        <p class="you"> You: "Wha.. what do you mean? What's the "Man", "Jonkler", and "Aslume"???" </p>
        <p class="man" id="bold"> Man: "I am Man, I am the night. The Jonkler has Jonked for too long at the aslume." </p>
        <p class="thought"> You have no idea what this "Man" is talking about. Or who this "Jonkler" person who "Jonks" is. Or even where this "Aslume" is. </p>
        <p class="you"> You: "So Man, who exactly is this "Jonkler", and why is he "Jonking" at the Aslume?"</p>
        <p class="man"> Man: "The Jonkler is my mortal enemy. Jonking is his way of spreading the insanity. It has even affected many parts of Gotham City, including myself. It's orginating from the Aslume." </p>
        <p class="thought" id="bold"> What. That makes even less sense. This may be the insanity spreading.</p>
        <p class="you"> You: "Soo, Man. Don't you have a Robin to be your aid instead of this random person?" </p>
        <p class="man"> Man: "Quick! There is no time for Robin, I need your help."</p>
        <p class="thought"> As you raise your voice to object, Man grabs you. You fly off with Man on his grappling hook. In the span of a couple seconds, both of you arrive at the Aslume.</p>
        <p class="jonkler"> Jonkler: "So you have arrived, Man. And ooo.... you're... hm I'll name you Bin"</p>
        <p class="thought"> He points at you, proclaiming your new name. You open your mouth to retort to say your actual name, but then... </p>

    <div>
        <p class="thought"> You realize something you never did. You are not a banker working at Gotham City, but a impoverished, tired Asian woman that's a sophomore at UIUC. This revelation makes no sense, since you are still sure you are in Gotham City. You have spent your entire life in Gotham City. </p>
        <p class="jonkler"> Jonkler: Don't you love the taste of being Jonkled???</p>
        <p class="man"> Man: Stop! Don't let yourself be Jonkled!!! If you don't fight it, you'll break!</p>
        <p class="thought" id="bold"> Your mind tears and you scream from the newfound realization. </p>
        <p class="thought"> You try your best to resist. </p>
        <p class="thought"> Resist it. </p>
        <p class="thought"> Resist it. I am from Gotham City. </p>
        <p class="thought"> Resist it. Resist. </p>
        <p class="thought"> Resist it. I am just a banker. </p>
        <p class="thought"> Resist. Resist. Resist. </p>
        <p class="thought"> I'm just me. For now, the insanity has been staved off. The Man pats me on the back for doing such a great job. </p>
        <p class="man"> Man: "That's the spirit" </p>
